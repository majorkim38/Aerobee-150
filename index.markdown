The **Aerobee 150A** is a four-fin sounding rocket approximately 9 meters long and 38 centimeters in diameter, manufactured by [Space-General Corporation][aerojet] and first flown in February, 1960. The rocket is capable of transporting 45 to 130 kilograms payloads to high altitudes (over 200 kilometers) with a stable, near vertical trajectory. The rocket is a free-flight, fin-stabilized, tower-launched, vehicle consisting of a liquid propellant sustainer and a solid propellant booster. The rocket is rolled (spun) during flight to decrease dispersion.
